```css
@theme inline {
  --color-primary: 210 40% 40%;      /* Primary brand color */
  --color-accent: 15 60% 55%;        /* Terracotta accent */
  --color-background: 0 0% 100%;     /* White background */
  /* ... more tokens */
}

### Content
All content is located in component files. Update text, images, and property listings directly in:
- `components/hero.tsx` — Hero content
- `components/property-grid.tsx` — Property listings
- `components/about.tsx` — Company information

### Animations
Adjust animation timing and effects in individual components. Look for `framer-motion` variants like:

```tsx
const fadeInUp = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }
}
```
